# SML Environment
SML Environment is an extension for
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), allowing short executions
like [EMACS sml-mode](https://www.smlnj.org/doc/Emacs/sml-mode.html) and
providing a text-highlight with some auto-complete features.

This project is been developed by **Vinícius Julião**
([`@vrjuliao`](https://github.com/vrjuliao)), but the text-highlight is an 
updated version of
[Standard ML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=freebroccolo.sml) extension
by **Darin Morrison** ([`@freebroccolo`](https://github.com/freebroccolo/))

- `use` statement:\
  To import a file to the environment, specify the filepath considering the
  workspace root directory as the starting point.
  For instance, if you have opened the folder `my_codes/workdir/`, and want to
  import `my_codes/workdir/foo.sml`, then type:
  ```sml
  use "foo.sml"
  ```
